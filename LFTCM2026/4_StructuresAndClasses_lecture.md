  # Structures and Classes

Recall that we finished our last class speaking about inductive types, and among those we mentioned
```
structure Iff (P Q : Prop) : Prop
    number of parameters: 2
    fields:
        Iff.mp : P → Q
        Iff.mpr : Q → P
    constructor: Iff.intro {P Q : Prop} (mp : P → Q) (mpr : Q → P) : P ↔ Q
```

Why did `#print Iff` begin with `structure` rather than with `inductive`?
Because it is a *structure* (with two fields):

> **Definition**
    A structure is an inductive type with a unique constructor.

Indeed, among inductive types (*i. e.* all types...), some are remarkably useful for formalising mathematical objects: those that *bundle* objects and properties together. So, we give them a different name.

As an example, let's see what a Monoid is:
```
structure Monoid (M : Type*) where
    | mul : M → M → M                        -- denoted *
    | one : M                                -- denoted 1
    | mul_assoc (a b c : M) : a * b * c = a * (b * c)
    | one_mul (a : M) : 1 * a = a
    | mul_one (a : M) : a * 1 = a
```
* Two of these fields are terms in types of kind `Type *`;
* three of them are terms in types of kind `Prop`;
* we often call a structure having constructor fields both in `Type *` and in `Prop` a *mixin*.

So, 
* a *monoid structure* on `M` is a collection `⟨*, 1, mul_assoc, one_mul, mul_one⟩`
* a term of a monoid is just a term of it! The monoid is a type, so it comes with its terms even if it has more structure, which is encoded in a term `str : Monoid M`.

# Structures

Let's begin with three *painful* examples and three *crazy* errors: `⌘`

They show that basic manipulations "from first principles" are doable, but certainly the *wrong* way to go. The last example also showed that `Lean` is capable of understanding that every metric space comes with a "natural" topology, so it will automatically infer that it is a topological space (to which the lemma `Continuous.mul` applies:

  ```lean
  #check Continuous.mul

  theorem Continuous.mul : ∀ {M X : Type u} [TopologicalSpace M] [Mul M] [ContinuousMul M]
  [TopologicalSpace X] {f g : X → M} (hf : Continuous f) (hg : Continuous g) : Continuous (f * g)
  ```

## Groups
In this section we're going to see 
1. A bad definition of (the right notion of) group;
1. A complicated one of the same notion, adapted for formalisation — and its advantages; 
1. How to benefit from Mathlib, a huge library where all this has already been defined.

`⌘`

The problems with `WrongGroup` and `WrongSemigroup` are (among others...)
* We're carrying around `mul`, `one` and `inv`, together with the type: `α.one` or `X.mul` or `G.inv`...
* Math is full of hierarchies, and these are not respected (the associativity example...): but we don't want to re-prove a theorem on additive commutative groups for rings, then for commutative rings, then for integral domains, then for fields...
* Although we can create 
```
def Nplus : WrongSemigroup where
  carrier := ℕ
  mul := (· + ·) -- or fun x y ↦ x + y
  mul_assoc := add_assoc
```
it is unhandy to connect `Nplus` with `ℕ` *as types*.

### Extends

The right approach relies on the idea of *extending* structures. 

Suppose we've already defined a structure `PoorStructure` with fields `firstfield,...,nth_field` and  we want a new *richer* structure `RichStructure` that also contains the fields
`(n+1)st_field,...,rth_field`. We can either

* forget that we had `PoorStructure` and declare
  ```  
  structure RichStructure where
    firstfield : firstType
    secondfield : secondType
    ...
    rth_field : rth_Type
  ```

* declare that `RichStructure` **extends** `PoorStructure` inheriting terms from the latter:

  ```
  structure RichStructure extends PoorStructure where
      (n+1)st_field : (n+1)st_Type
      ...
      rth_field : rth_Type
  ```

+++ In details (*probably skipped during lecture*)
* The process can be iterated, yielding a structure extending several ones:

        VeryRichStructure extends Structure₁, Structure₂, Structure₃ where
            ...

* If the parent structures have overlapping field names, then all overlapping field names 
must have the **same type**. 
* If the overlapping fields have different default values, then the default value 
from the **last** parent structure that includes the field is used. New default values in the child
(= richer) structure take precedence over default values from the parent (= poorer) structures.

* The `with` (and `__`) syntax are able to "read through" the extension of structures.

### Classes and Class Inference
+++ Some automation we’ve just witnessed
1. Lean was able to "automatically" decide to use `1` and `*` for `G : Group` or `G : CommGroup`,
and to use `0` and `+` for `A : AddGroup` or `A : AddCommGroup`.
1. If we inspect `mul_assoc` we see
    ```
    mul_assoc {G : Type*} [Semigroup G] (a b c : G) : a * b * c = a * (b * c)
    ```
but we used it for a group: Lean understood that every group is a semigroup.

3. The use of `extend` to define `Group`, yielding an "enriched" `DivInvMonoid`.
4. Some redundancy in the definition of `Group` (of `Monoid`, actually) concerning `npow : ℕ → M → M`.

+++
Most of the above points are related to *classes* and *class type inference*.

Classes are special structures, for which certain terms are stored in a database. They enable **class type inference**, constructing a term of a certain class given a term of a "parent" one.

The idea is that each `class` type cointains a *preferred* or a *canonical* term, declared using the keyword `instance` rather than `def`; and this term has been registered in the database to be accessible whenever needed.
```quote
Warning: often, Classes have parameters, so if `G` and `H` are types, `Group G` and `Group H` are different types!
```
To introduce a class assumption in a lemma (*i. e.* to add a term to the local context), in a definition, or in a new class, we use `[` and `]` and typically *we don't name it*: because this should be useless.

To check what is the canonical term of a certain class type, use the command `#synth`, and to recall it use `inferInstance` (in term mode) or `infer_instance` (in tactic mode).

### More about groups

+++ Interlude: `Mathlib`
#### Main take-home message: it is huge!

You can access it on its [gitHub repo](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4) or, **much better**, through its [documentation website](https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/). It changes very rapidly (>10 times a day), so I created a ["frozen" documentation](https://faenuccio-teaching.github.io/Beijing_Jun26/docs/) website with the Mathlib version used in this course.

As a rule of thumb: 
* if something is below PhD level it is *probably* in Mathlib. Unless it is not.
* Generality is normally overwhelming, so if you don't find something you're probably looking in the wrong place.
* There is a [naming convention](https://leanprover-community.github.io/contribute/naming.html) for theorems (terms of `Prop`-valued types), for objects (terms in `Type*`), for properties (terms in `Prop`); together with plenty of exceptions and room for headache. Try to develop your feeling and ask for help. 
+++
#### Subgroups
The definition of subgroups is slightly different from that of a group, it relies on `Sets`:
```
structure Subgroup (G : Type*) [Group G] extends Submonoid G : Type* where
    carrier : Set G
    mul_mem' {a b : G} : a ∈ self.carrier → b ∈ self.carrier → a * b ∈ self.carrier
    one_mem' : 1 ∈ self.carrier
    inv_mem' {x : G} : x ∈ self.carrier → x⁻¹ ∈ self.carrier
```
We'll discuss what "sets" are in the next class, but for now just record that given any type `G : Type*`, 
and any set `S : Set G`, we obtain for every `g : G` the type (of kind `Prop`) `g ∈ S`, that can be either inhabited (the proposition is true) or empty (the proposition is false).

Exactly as we've discussed for monoids, that of "being a subgroup" is not a `Prop`-like
notion: rather, to each group `G` we attach a new *type* `Subgroup G` whose terms
represent the different subgroups of `G`, each seen as an underlying set and a collection of proofs that
the set is multiplicatively closed (a "mixin").

Finally, the type `Subgroup G` is ordered, and `{1} : Subgroup G` is actually `⊥` (the bottom element, written `\bot`) whereas `G : Subgroup G` is `⊤` (the top element, written `\top`).

`⌘`

#### Homomorphisms
Given *monoids* `M` and `N`, a *monoid* homomorphism is a function `f : M → N` that respects the operations and the units. There could be (at least) two ways to define this: 

1. Declare the property `MonHom : (M → N) → Prop` as

        def MonHom : (M → N) → Prop := f ↦ ( ∀ a b, f (a * b) = (f a) * (f b) ) ∧ (f 1 = 1)
    
and let `MonoidHom` be the subtype

    MonoidHom = {f : M → N // MonHom f}
This would mean that a monoid homomorphism is a pair `⟨f, hf : MonHom f⟩`.

2. Define a new type `MonoidHom M N`, as a structure

        structure MonoidHom M N where
        | toFun : M → N
        | map_mul : ∀ a b, toFun (a * b) = (toFun a) * (toFun b)
        | map_one : toFun 1 = 1

so that terms of `MonoidHom M N` would be *triples* `⟨f, map_mul f, map_one f⟩`.

These approaches are not *very* different, the problem with the first is that to access the proofs one has to destructure `hf` to `hf.1` and `hf.2`. Imagine if there were 20 properties...


* A **group homomorphism** is just a monoid homomorphism: the property `f (x⁻¹) = (f x)⁻¹` can be proven. But this relies on class type inference...
  
  +++ Why does it rely on class type inference?
  Because if we only define monoid homomorphisms, then when `G` and `H` are groups and we write `f : G →* H` Lean would complain that `G` and `H` are not monoids. By class type inference, it understands that they are *also* monoids.
  +++

* **Take-home message**: homomorphisms between algebraic structures are structures on their own, "bundling" together the underline function and all its properties.

It will be another story for continuous/differentiable/smooth functions...

`⌘`
#### Quotients
To define quotients, we clearly need equivalence relations:
```
class Setoid (α : Sort u) where
  r : α → α → Prop
  iseqv : Equivalence r
```

Observe that `α` is a parameter, so a term in `Setoid α` is an equivalence relation on `α`. This comes with a notation `a ≈ b` (typed as `\~~`) meaning that `r a b`, *i. e.* `a,b : α` are equivalent.

+++ Why a class instead of a structure? Isn't this an obsession?
It would not change much, and in many *explicit* occurrences terms of `Setoid α` are actually named and in parenthesis, as in `(s : Setoid α)`. But we want automation, for example in order to find the *canonical* equivalence relation on `G ⧸ H` under the assumption that `H` is normal, and not having Lean asking us to choose one relation each time.
+++

Given `s : Setoid α` we can construct `Quotient s`: it is a type whose terms correspond to equivalence classes of `s`, yet **I cannot define it because it is a Lean primitive**.

But the important things are not definitions, **it is the API**:
* `Quotient.mk s : α → Quotient s` is the quotient map (and `Quotient.mk _ x` is denoted `⟦x⟧`, with `\[[` and `\]]`);
* `Quotient.out : Quotient s → α` sends `x : Quotient s` to a lift
of `x`, **using the axiom of choice**;
* `Quotient.lift` : given a term `f : α → β` satisfying `a ≈ b → f a = f b`, the term `Quotient.lift f : Quotient s → β` satisfies `(Quotient.lift f) ∘ Quotient.mk s = f`;

+++ And two more esoteric ones:
* `Quotient.rep [Encodable α] : Quotient s → α` without using the axiom of choice, provided that `α` is **encodable**, *i. e.* it is endowed with a (chosen) bijection into a subset of `ℕ` (we also need `s.r` to be decidable: for all `a, b`, either `a ≈ b` or `¬ a ≈ b`).
* `axiom Quotient.sound {a b : α} : a ≈ b → ⟦a⟧ = ⟦b⟧`: it is (almost) an axiom.
+++

In the special case of `{G : Type*}  [Group G] (H : Subgroup G)` there are two relations: `x y ↦ x * y⁻¹ ∈ H` and `x y ↦ x⁻¹ * y ∈ H` (can you understand their *signature*?), giving rise to
* the corresponding `Quotient (QuotientGroup.leftRel H) : Type*`, denoted `G ⧸ H` (where `⧸` is `\/`, or `\quot` and not `/`);
* the corresponding `Quotient (QuotientGroup.rightRel H) : Type*`;
* the corresponding bare function `Quotient.mk (QuotientGroup.leftRel H) : G → G ⧸ H`;
* the *much more interesting* `Quotient.mk' _ : [_ : H.Normal] → G →* G ⧸ H`.

## Rings

From the theoretical point of view, all algebraic structures look alike: so I'll present a (slightly long) summary of what we need about rings, and then there will be plenty of examples.

### Definition and basic tactics

As for groups, the way to say that `R` is a ring is to type

    (R : Type*) [Ring R]

The library is particularly rich insofar as *commutative* rings are concerned, and we're going to stick to those in our course.

* The tactic `ring` solves claim about basic relations in commutative rings, namely those that hold in *free* rings.
* The tactic `grind` is much more powerful (but it oten calls the axiom of choice for no good reason: we won't care): beyond what `ring` can do, it also treats inequalities, logical connectives, local assumptions, etc.

Given what we know about groups and monoids, we can expect a commutative ring to have several "weaker" structures: typically these can be accessed through a `.toWeakStructure` projection.


### Morphisms, Ideals and Quotients.

* Morphisms work as for groups: they are functions respecting both structures on a ring, that of a multiplicative monoid and of an additive group: so, they're respecting both monoid structures, hence the notation `R →+* S` for a ring homomorphism. Of course, `≃+*` denotes ring isomorphism, so `R ≃+* S` is the type of all ring homomorphisms from `R` to `S`.

* In the usual spirit of working in the greatest possible generality, `I : Ideal R` means `I : Submodule R R`.

Concretely, a term `I : Ideal R` is such that

        | I.carrier : Set R
        | I.zero_mem : (0 : R) ∈ I
        | I.add_mem (x y : R) : x ∈ I → y ∈ I → x + y ∈ I
        | I.smul_mem (x y : R) : x ∈ I → x • y ∈ I

The `smul_mem` field is part of the definition, but it is sometimes handier to use either of

        I.mul_mem_left (a b : R) : b ∈ I → a * b ∈ I

or

        I.mul_mem_right (a b : R) : a ∈ I → a * b ∈ I

As for subgroups, the type `Ideal R` is ordered, with `⊥ = {0} : Ideal R` and `⊤ = R : Ideal R`.

* The discussion about quotient rings is analogous to the one for quotient groups, through the *same* setoid structure (called `Submodule.quotientRel`)
```
@[to_additive]
def leftRel (s : Subgroup α) : Setoid α := MulAction.orbitRel s.op α
```
where `to_additive` fires, becoming `fun x y ↦ x - y ∈ I.toAddSubgroup`.

As for groups, it is often better to replace `Quotient.mk (Submodule.quotientRel I)` by 
`Ideal.Quotient.mk I : R →+* R ⧸ I`.
